This is an implementation of a 2D version of the learning/rendering algorithm described here: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.04079.pdf

All the code is in splat.py - to run it, it requires a single mandatory argument, a config file.

For convenience, two examples are available, each with a *.cmd file that contains a the command line and outputs stdout to a log file.

Credits:

- Example buddy.png has been taken from another implementation of 2D Gaussian Splatting (found here: https://github.com/OutofAi/2D-Gaussian-Splatting) that I have used as a benchmark (and, as yet, have not met)

- Example cat.png has been deliberately chosen to be more detailed, textured, and generally more difficult. It depicts Sultana, my owner and overlord.
